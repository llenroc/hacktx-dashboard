# HackTX Demo Code - see it live [here](https://bit.ly/hacktxkeen)

### Deployed with [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-python-o)

This code is currently being refactored to allow any organization to create a metrics dashboard. Also, the data model that was initially used within the Keen IO events is not that great and also being refactored. The new project will live [here](https://github.com/tbarn/github-dashboards).

Feel free to add issues for features you'd like to see or work on.
